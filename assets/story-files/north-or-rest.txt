'I like your enthusiasm', the witch remarks. 
'The Bog is north of here and the talisman is shaped like a cat. 
That's all I know but I promise a hefty reward on your return.'

Would you like to:

1. Head north immediately; don't waste a second.

2. Isn't it nighttime? You should rest before heading off.
