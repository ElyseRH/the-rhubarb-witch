You all set off north. As you reach the Bog half a dozen spike-covered heads pop up from behind the shubbery. 
Punk goblins! Your  unneccessarily long sword should come in handy here.
You unsheath the sword, which shines gloriously. 
You use your speed to move in close to the goblins, hold the sword at throat height and pirouette like a ballerina on closing night, 
full of confidence. You take out all the goblins at once.
You and your adventuring party have a celebratory group hug. 
You have successfully entered the Bog and you can see the dark talisman from here. 
It glows brightly; did the goblins curse it? You:

1. Go grab it barehanded 

2. Pull some ovenmitts from your bag and go pick it up
