Your friends figure out what's happening and one of them gives you the heimlich maneuver, 
which works for some reason. You slam the door on your way out, 
to let the proprietor know that you are not happy with the service 
and will be leaving a bad review on YoYelp (Ye old Yelp).
You take the rocky path leading to a cottage owned by a local witch. 
Perhaps she has a quest for you.
