The talisman is cold to the touch; you quickly pull your hand away 
but it is too late. You watch ice crystals rapidly form over your hand, 
shoot up your arm and across your entire body until you can no longer move. 
Your friends pick up your frozen body and carry you out of the Bog; 
you may have failed in your quest, but you have made some true friends.

Game Over.
