Everyone sits down at the counter and orders a coffee 
from the elf behind the counter. Your latte arrives; 
you take a sip and as you look at the beautiful rosetta 
on top, the world begins to spin. 
You've been poisoned! You:

1. Jump over the counter and strangle the elf. 
If I'm going down, you're coming with me.

2. Turn to your new friends and make garbled, 
panicked noises until they understand what's happening.
