This is a choose your own adventure game; please pick a character to play with.
Be mindful who you choose, it will affect the outcome of your choices!
Each time you have to make a decision, I will roll a dice to see whether 
you succeed or fail, so choose carefully! If you roll above 10 you can go your
chosen way, if you roll below 10 then I will send you on the other path.

Your options are:

1. Barbarian
You are very proficient with weapons but are prone to fly into a rage 
at a moment's notice. You often make rash, but bold decisions.

2. Rogue
You are stealthy and can wield magic daggers. You often make clever 
but sneaky decisions, and you look exactly like Aragorn. 

3. Sorcerer
You were born with an arcane magical power. You're mysterious 
and can call familiars to your side (preference for cats).
