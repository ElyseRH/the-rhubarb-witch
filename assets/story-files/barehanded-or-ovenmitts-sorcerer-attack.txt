You all set off north. As you reach the Bog half a dozen spike-covered heads pop up from behind the shubbery. 
Punk goblins! Your  unneccessarily long sword should come in handy here.
You unsheath the sword and use your innate arcane power to send it flying into the air. 
The goblins squeak in terror at this display of strength and flee the Bog.
You and your adventuring party have a celebratory group hug. 
You have successfully entered the Bog and you can see the dark talisman from here. 
It glows brightly; did the goblins curse it? You:

1. Go grab it barehanded 

2. Pull some ovenmitts from your bag and go pick it up
