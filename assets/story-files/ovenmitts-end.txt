You pick up the talisman; you can feel that it is very cold 
but it doesn't penetrate your trusty ovenmitts. 
You pop it in your companions purse and all leave the Bog together. 
You journey back to the witch's cottage, which takes 10 days 
and 10 nights, for some reason. When you arrive the witch decurses
... uncurses... removes the curse from the talisman and gives you 
a golden statue of a pig. You pawn it at a local place and 
each receive half a million oglots.

You Win!
