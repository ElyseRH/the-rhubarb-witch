You all set off north. As you reach the Bog half a dozen spike-covered heads pop up from behind the shubbery. 
Punk goblins! Your  unneccessarily long sword should come in handy here.
In fact, this could be two swords. You snap the sword in half and deftly start stabbing goblins, 
who are bobbing up and down like a game of whack a mole. Carnival music starts playing, 
which fades out as you skewer the last punk.
You and your adventuring party have a celebratory group hug. 
You have successfully entered the Bog and you can see the dark talisman from here. 
It glows brightly; did the goblins curse it? You:

1. Go grab it barehanded 

2. Pull some ovenmitts from your bag and go pick it up
