You enter a busy, raucous inn. You see a table with three adventurers huddled closely around it and approach them. 
They eye you with distrust; to prove yourself as a worthy travelling companion you somersault over the table
 and discreetly take the barbarian's dagger, returning it to them with a lustrous flip of your hair.
The others accept you and you all head outside together. 
There are two paths; your new companions turn to you, entrusting you with the first decision of the journey. Do you:

1. Take the rocky path leading to a cottage owned by a local witch. Perhaps she has a quest for you.

2. Follow a bridge leading to a specialty cafe and roastery. A proper coffee sounds really good right now.
