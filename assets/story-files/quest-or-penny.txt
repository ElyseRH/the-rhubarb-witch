You arrive at the witch's cottage and politely knock on the door.
A rectangular piece of metal slides to the left, 
revealing a park of dark purple eyes. From inside someone bellows 
'What do you want?' You answer:

1. 'Uhhhhh... we were looking for a quest? Do you do those here?'

2. 'Would you spare a penny to help mend the inn roof?'
