You enter a busy, raucous inn. You see a table with three 
adventurers huddled closely around it and approach them. 
They eye you with distrust; to prove yourself as a worthy 
travelling companion you make a powerful fireball with 
only your hands; then accidentally set the roof on fire 
but promptly put it out, showing off both your arcane magic and your speed.
The others accept you and you all head outside together. 
There are two paths; your new companions turn to you, 
entrusting you with the first decision of the journey. Do you:

1. Take the rocky path leading to a cottage owned by a local witch. Perhaps she has a quest for you.

2. Follow a bridge leading to a specialty cafe and roastery. A proper coffee sounds really good right now.
