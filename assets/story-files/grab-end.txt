You grab the talisman and return to your friends. 
You all look at each other; do we have to journey 
all the way back to the witch's cottage now? 
At that exact moment a huge eagle swoops down and 
gently picks up all three party members in its talons, 
conveniently taking you back to the cottage very quickly 
(so as not to let the audience get bored). 
When you arrive at the cottage the witch gives you 
a winning lottery ticket and the three of you divvy up 
four million oglots the following week.
